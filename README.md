# California Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview

This project utilizes various machine learning models to predict energy consumption in California, based on diverse pricing data. SARIMAX, Linear, Dense, Multi-Step Dense, and LSTM models have been developed and evaluated on their predictive performance.

## Scope

Our models generate energy consumption predictions for periods of 2, 5, and 10 years into the future. Factors such as trends and seasonality, price data, policy alterations, and technological advancements are considered in our predictions.

## Value

The project's outcomes are valuable for energy firms, policymakers, and other stakeholders. It aids in strategizing future energy demand and supply, with a primary focus on building more efficient and sustainable energy systems.

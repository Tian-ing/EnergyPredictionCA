# California Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview

This project utilizes various machine learning models to predict energy consumption in California, based on diverse pricing data. SARIMAX, Linear, Dense, Multi-Step Dense, and LSTM models have been developed and evaluated on their predictive performance.

## Scope

Our models generate energy consumption predictions for periods of 2, 5, and 10 years into the future. Factors such as trends and seasonality, price data, policy alterations, and technological advancements are considered in our predictions.

## Value

The project's outcomes are valuable for energy firms, policymakers, and other stakeholders. It aids in strategizing future energy demand and supply, with a primary focus on building more efficient and sustainable energy systems.

## Running the Code

Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Navigate to the `FrankDong` directory.

2. Download the `dataCA` folder. This folder contains the necessary data for our models.

3. Once you have the data, you can execute notebooks we have in the folder. These notebooks contain the code that runs our models and generates the corresponding visualizations.

Please ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your environment to run the Jupyter notebooks.
